#Text-to-Speech React App

#Description:

This project is a dynamic Text-to-Speech (TTS) web application built using React. The app enables users to convert written text into spoken words, providing a versatile and accessible way to consume textual information. The application includes several features to enhance the user experience.

#Key Features:

#Word Preparation and Timing:
The application intelligently prepares text for synthesis by breaking it down into words, estimating their reading times based on English language norms. Each word is associated with its start time, enabling the triggering of events such as animations or visual cues synchronized with the spoken words.

#Real-time Speech Synthesis:
The app utilizes the react-speech-kit library to seamlessly integrate with the browser's speech synthesis capabilities. Users can start and stop speech synthesis, adjusting volume on-the-fly for a personalized experience.

#Voice Selection:
Users can choose from available voices for a customized auditory experience. The app dynamically fetches available voices using the window.speechSynthesis.getVoices() API, allowing users to select their preferred voice.

#Volume Control and User Interaction:
A user-friendly slider allows users to control the volume of the synthesized speech. The application also provides buttons to start, stop, and prepare the text, ensuring ease of interaction.

#Save Speech and Timing Data:
Future improvements will include the ability to save the synthesized speech as an MP3 or WAV file.

#Responsive Design:
The app is designed with a responsive layout, adapting to various screen sizes for a seamless experience across different devices.

#Technologies Used:

React: Leveraging the power of React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
react-speech-kit: Integrating this library to harness the browser's speech synthesis capabilities in a React application.
Future Improvements:

#The project is open to future enhancements such as adjustable speech rate, additional language support, improved accessibility features, and the capability to save synthesized speech and word timing data.
